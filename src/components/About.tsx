          <p>
            I’m a passionate and results-driven Software Engineer with a strong
            foundation in backend development, distributed systems, and machine
            learning. Currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science and
            Statistics at Northwestern University with a 3.94 GPA, I specialize
            in designing scalable architectures, optimizing system performance,
            and developing robust APIs.
          </p>
          <p>
            My experience spans large-scale data processing, cloud
            infrastructure (AWS, GCP), and event-driven architectures, with
            hands-on expertise in building secure and efficient systems. I’ve
            contributed to various projects involving real-time financial
            analytics, AI-enhanced content generation, and distributed
            computing, leveraging technologies like Python, C++, JavaScript, and
            Go.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond technical skills, I thrive in solving complex problems and
            collaborating on impactful projects that push the boundaries of
            innovation. Always eager to learn and improve, I’m looking to
            contribute to teams where I can make a meaningful impact in software
            development and system design.
